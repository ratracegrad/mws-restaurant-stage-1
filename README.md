accessibility access. This website was created as a project for the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree
which I am completing because I won a Google Scholarship.

## Live Demo
I have a [live demo](https://restaurant-reviews-jb.firebaseapp.com/) of this website that you can view.

## Website Overview
This website provides information on restaurants located in the New York, NY metro area.
The main page of the website provides a google map that shows all the restaurant locations with a pin. Below
the map is a list of all restaurants that I currently have in my database.
Here is an example of what the home page of the website looks like:
